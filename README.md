# Jad's Curriculum Vitae iOS App

## iOS Application

I am an avid iOS & Mac OS X developer who likes to think of new ways to present things. Therefore, my CV has been written in the form of a universal iOS application. The code (under a [BSD 3-Clause](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)) is available to download, browse and use.

### Compiling The Application

To compile the application you will need to run Mac OS X with [Xcode 5.1+](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed. Then simply open the ```Jad's CV.xcodeproj``` file and run the application.

**Note:** To run it on a personal iOS device you will need to have an active full [iOS Developer](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/) account. Alternatively you could go through TestFlight as per the below instructions.

### TestFlight

Through [TestFlight](http://help.testflightapp.com/customer/portal/articles/402851-testflight-faq) you can download the application without the need for the App Store.

By completing the [recruitment information](http://tflig.ht/1gycrc2) I will be able to authorise you to download the application and you will have access to the latest uploaded builds.

## Old Fashioned Way

If you cannot compile or download the app, the file ```CV.pdf``` above can be downloaded. However, the PDF version of my CV is slightly less informative than the app as the projects I worked on have been omitted.
