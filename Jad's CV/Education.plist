	<string>I was elected by the software engineering / computer science cohort to act as their representative. This requires me to liaise between the student body and the course lecturers. I conduct meetings with faculty members to help improve the educational system of the school of computer science. I also work on improving the social aspect of studentâ€™s life on campus through encouraging active social and educational involvements in university clubs. I was re-elected this year.</string>
