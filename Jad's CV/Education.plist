	<string>During my studies at the University of Western Australia I made the most of all social and educational opportunities. I joined several clubs and was elected as a committee member for both social and educational clubs. 

UWA taught me to learn and to create my own opportunities which allowed me to move faster in the software industry. The School of Software Engineering showed me that people can create the most astonishing innovations. University was a hub where I met many similar minded students and lecturers with whom to share and challenge ideas</string>
